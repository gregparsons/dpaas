  *Title:* Drone Pilot as a Service: A safe, scalable web service for beyond-line-of-sight drone flight
  *
  **Abstract:** 
  *
  Consumer “drones” are available to a widening audience. Increasing onboard compute power has also opened up an array of practical opportunities for commercial and humanitarian organizations alike to reduce time, monetary and environmental costs, as well as risk in jobs where humans were previously required. Many of these benefits from drones will come to fruition when “beyond line of sight” flight becomes a reality. Currently, drones are piloted by operators in real-time who maintain ``line of sight'' with the drones they control.

  This project develops the technology necessary to enable beyond-line-of-sight drone piloting over the Internet. We define an airspace framework, modeled after flight routing used by commercial pilots operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), and the Internet service architecture necessary to implement request-response drone control -- i.e. ``Drones as a Service.''

  The talk outlines the system and demonstrates web-service-controlled flight using a mobile phone client as a control interface.

  Everyone welcome!
